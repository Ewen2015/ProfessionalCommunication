# Research for HSBC

### What is it?

HSBC is one of the world's largest banking and financial services organisations. 

### What does it do?

We serve more than 47 million customers through our four Global Businesses: Retail Banking and Wealth Management, Commercial Banking, Global Banking and Markets, and Global Private Banking. 

### Purpose

Throughout our history we have been where the growth is, connecting customers to opportunities. We enable businesses to thrive and economies to prosper, helping people fulfil their hopes and dreams and realise their ambitions. This is our role and purpose.

**Comments:** I like the word "connect". 
In my opinion, "connect" is the essence of finance. Finance connects the money, from people to people, from place to place, from furture to now. It really enlarges the scope of possibility. 
In terms of the purpose of company, I really like that your company puts the emphasis on customers and regards your success as helping others, not just the company itself.

### Values

At HSBC, how we do business is as important as what we do. We seek to build trust-based and lasting relationships with our many stakeholders to generate value in society and deliver long-term shareholder returns.
We believe in acting with courageous integrity. 

**Comments:** Your values are very impressive for me. Integrity is one of the most great charactor I value.

To ensure we achieve this growth in the right way, we place great emphasis on our values, and are committed to applying the highest standards everywhere we do business. 
We want our people to feel able to speak up for what is right.

We put diversity at the heart of our business. 
Joining HSBC will give you the chance to work in a collegiate, supportive and inclusive environment in which we seek to develop and promote people based on merit. 
We will provide you with tailored training and support to help you identify and follow your chosen career path, as well as access to a range of market-competitive benefits.
